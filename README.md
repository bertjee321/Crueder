# Personal Resume Page (practice project)
## created with React library

This is one of my first projects, which I created to practice programming and - at the same time - show what I can do in the field of Web App development.

The app is linked to a database from which the data is extracted, the frontend code makes sure the data is correctly displayed on the page. The full functionality of the app, like sending data to the database, is 'hidden' behind an Admin Login (however, this is currently still a DUMMY login). 

To view the full functionalities, you can use the DUMMY_LOGIN using the following credentials:
- username: bkruiter91
- password: 1234

Please note that writing to the database is set to 'false' So that content cannot be edited.
